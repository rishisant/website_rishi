                Well, for starters, my name's Rishi. The best (and simplest) way to pronounce
                it is by saying "fishy" with an 'r' in lieu of an 'f'. At the time of writing this,
                I'm currently a third-year Comp. Sci student at Texas A&M University, planning on 
                graduating by or before May 2024. I'm pursuing a minor in business, and although it's 
                too early for me to make the decision, I'm planning on (eventually) obtaining an MBA.

                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                I was born in sunny Palm Springs, California. I grew up there for a few years
                before my family moved to Texas. I've been a Texan ever since, living in both
                San Antonio and the Greater Houston area. 

                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                My interest in computers primarily stemmed from the time I spent with them as
                a child. The first PC that I ever coded on was my Dad's old Windows XP computer.
                He opened my eyes to the possibilities that come with computers; these were
                humble beginnings. I used to make Notepad and Calculator-like apps using 
                Visual Basic and the .NET framework, following YouTube tutorials and making my
                own tutorials (which I later realized had horrible quality and no audio, but then again,
                I was only 10 years old).

                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                I spent a good portion of my childhood coding video games and small projects,
                and even ventured deeper into graphic design (particularly for games). I learned
                how to design fonts, graphics, code, and worked with audio engineering. One of my
                strengths is my ability to pick up new skills; I wouldn't necessarily call myself an expert at
                anything, but I'm pretty decent at a lot of things.

                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                My interest in Computer Science has continually increased, whether it be from the
                curriculum at A&M, or from simply being around such a didactic environment. I love
                (as most of us do) the prospects that come with Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                Learning. I also enjoy Cybersecurity Law, Cloud Computing, and a plethora of other
                CS-related topics.

                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Nowadays, outside of school, I try to work on one large project every semester.
                I enjoy coding and problem solving, but outside of programming, I have a wide variety
                of interests. Basketball, lifting weights, learning languages, and reading are all
                some of my favorite hobbies. I played basketball back in high school, and I continue
                to play in college intramurals. Plus I'm fairly tall, so that helps.

                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                As for reading, at the moment I'm reading quite a few books, but my favorite right now
                is <i>Demon-Haunted World</i> by Carl Sagan.
