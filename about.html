            My name's Rishi. Duh! But let me tell you more about my journey here.

            <br><br>I was born in sunny Palm Springs, California. I grew up there for a few years before
            <br>my parents packed their bags and moved out. I've called Texas my home ever since,
            <br>living in San Antonio and the Greater Houston area.

            <br><br>The first PC that I ever coded on was my Dad's old Windows XP computer. He showed me
            <br>the possibilities that come with computers and although he was never too proficient in
            <br>them, he let me discover the world of computers through video games, graphic design,
            <br>audio engineering, and of course, programming.

            <br><br>I spent a good portion of my childhood coding video games and small projects,
            <br>designing fonts, graphics, code, and much much more. It was an incredibly
            <br>gratifying experience, considering that I had so much more free-time to indulge
            <br>in my personal projects.

            <br><br>Nowadays, outside of school, I try to work on one large project every semester. I seriously
            <br>enjoy coding and problem solving, but outside of that, I have a wide variety of interests.

            <br><br>I enjoy playing basketball, lifting weights, learning languages, and reading in my free
            <br>time. 

            <br><br>I'm currently reading <i>Demon-Haunted World</i> by Carl Sagan.
