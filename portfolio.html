            Here are some of the projects I've worked on in the past year.

            <br><br>
            <subtext id="sidetoside">WordChain</subtext>
            WordChain is a game about chaining words together. A chain is denoted by two or more
            <br>words which both connect through sharing similar letters. You are given a topic, such as
            <br>countries, in which your first word must be the name of a Country. Say you answer with
            <br>Brazil. The next word must start with the last letter of the previous word, so in this
            <br>case, <i>'l'</i> must be the first character of the second word.
            <br><br>Try the game here: <a href="https://rishisant.github.io/wordchain/">Play Now!</a>

            <subtext id="sidetoside">Eigood</subtext>
            Eigood is a project I started in order to teach casual/colloquial English to Japanese speakers.
            <br>Eigood contains custom English lessons, tailored specifically for Japanese native speakers.
            <br>I got the chance to interact with my Japanese user base and created multiple lessons that are
            <br>within the application itself. I created Eigood with Swift and SwiftUI through XCode.

            <subtext id="sidetoside">World of Wreckage</subtext>
            The World of Wreckage: Analyzing Salvaged Vehicles is a project completed during TAMU Datathon 2021.
            <br>Me and my team analyzed salvaged vehicles, a good substitute due to the expensive used car market.
            <br>This was our first time ever web-scraping and we were able to make a pretty solid analysis. I also got to work
            <br>on an algorithm that would evaluate the estimated profit of a car, based on a plethora of variables such as brand,
            <br>make, model, damage type, damage severity, odometer readings, and more!

            <br><br>
            <subtext id="sidetoside">Custom Discord Bot</subtext>
            I created a custom discord bot for my friend's server! This was my first time ever creating a custom Discord bot
            <br>so there were quite a few challenges. I made the bot in Python. Here is my favorite command (!!zingo) running on
            <br>my test server a while ago. The bot has a few commands it can run, such as !!number <i>x y</i>, which starts a
            <br>number guessing game from 0 to x with y number of guesses. It also has commands such as !!gasmeup which gives the
            <br>user a nice compliment upon invocation.

            <subtext id="sidetoside">Empire Simulator</subtext>
            Empire Simulator was the first web project I had taken on. My goal was to create a simulator game in
            <br>which you create your own empire. There are three playable archetypes, each with varying strengths.
            <br>This game was never fully completed, however, I got a decent amount of the game mapped out already.
