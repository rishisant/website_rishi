                Atelier provides a unique and convenient platform for artists to showcase their work, and for art lovers to discover new and exciting artists and artworks. 
                With Atelier, everyone can appreciate and support the arts in a fun and easy way. I founded Atelier for the sole purpose of removing the barriers that prevent 
                artists from sharing their work with the world, as well as improve feedback mechanisms such as like buttons, substituting them for a more meaningful and 
                engaging voting system. Atelier is currently in development, and I am the sole developer. I am using React.js for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                WordChain is a game about chaining words together. A chain is denoted by two or more
                words which both connect through sharing similar letters. You are given a topic, such as
                countries, in which your first word must be the name of a Country. Say you answer with
                Brazil. The next word must start with the last letter of the previous word, so in this
                case, <i>'l'</i> must be the first character of the second word.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                NamuDB is a program that allows you to store and retrieve data from a database. It creates
                a database file, which you can then add, remove, and edit data from. For data security, all
                .namu files are encrypted with a custom-generated encryption key, unique to the .namu database.
                The encryption key is stored in the same .namu file and is also encrypted with another unique
                key; this double encryption makes the data in the .namu file virtually impossible to decrypt
                without the key.

            <subtext id="sidetoside">Population Simulation: A Study on Gene Variance</subtext>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                I created a sample organism in Python and programmed it to live in an environment. This
                organism's only goal is to find food in order to survive and reproduce. I added genetic
                variance within this environment, with each gene giving an organism a certain ability to
                aid it in survival. This study highlighted which genes survive in certain environments and
                which genes could not.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                TeachCPP is a Git Repository I made, aiming to teach beginners the fundamentals of C++.
                By working through custom-designed modules and problems, users can seek to get a hold
                of important concepts in C++, such as memory management, pointers, and data structures. I've
                included a YouTube video link that demos my first module.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Eigood is a project I started in order to teach casual/colloquial English to Japanese speakers.
            Eigood contains custom English lessons, tailored specifically for Japanese native speakers.
            I got the chance to interact with my Japanese user base and created multiple lessons that are
            within the application itself. I created Eigood with Swift and SwiftUI through XCode.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The World of Wreckage: Analyzing Salvaged Vehicles is a project completed during TAMU Datathon 2021.
            Me and my team analyzed salvaged vehicles, a good substitute due to the expensive used car market.
            This was our first time ever web-scraping and we were able to make a pretty solid analysis. I also got to work
            on an algorithm that would evaluate the estimated profit of a car, based on a plethora of variables such as brand,
            make, model, damage type, damage severity, odometer readings, and more!

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                I created a custom discord bot for my friend's server! This was my first time ever creating a custom Discord bot
            so there were quite a few challenges. I made the bot in Python. Here is my favorite command (!!zingo) running on
            my test server a while ago. The bot has a few commands it can run, such as !!number <i>x y</i>, which starts a
            number guessing game from 0 to x with y number of guesses. It also has commands such as !!gasmeup which gives the
            user a nice compliment upon invocation.

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Empire Simulator was the first web project I had taken on. My goal was to create a simulator game in
            which you create your own empire. There are three playable archetypes, each with varying strengths.
            This game was never fully completed, however, I got a decent amount of the game mapped out already.
